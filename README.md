# SafeC
SafeC Programming Language

## What is SafeC?

SafeC is a programming language designed to be a "safe" C programming language. It's just like the C language, except it is safe and not dangerous. SafeC has the exact same syntax and semantics with the C programming language.

## How does SafeC work?

SafeC transcompiles to C, then uses a C compiler (GCC, clang, etc.) to compile the C code to an executable.

## Why SafeC?

SafeC lets you make safe C code. It also has generics, lists/vectors, hashmaps, and etc.
